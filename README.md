## Requirements

Primarily built for nvim but it works pretty well with vim. However here are
some requirements to take full advantage of the theme:

- 24-bit RGB colors (vim compiled with +termguicolors)
- Terminal or GUI with bold and italic support

## Usage

Install using your favorite plugin manager and just apply the colorscheme as
usual:

```vim
set termguicolors
colorscheme zenbones
```

Alternatively, if you want to make use of lua or forked this repo and tweaked
the colors to your liking:

```vim
set termguicolors
colorscheme zenbones-lua
```

To make it work however, you must install lush.

## Inspirations

Zenbones is heavily inspired by
[Vervandi](https://github.com/be5invis/vsc-theme-verdandi) and
[vim-yin-yang](https://github.com/pgdouyon/vim-yin-yang). The name came from
this [small book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Flesh,_Zen_Bones).
